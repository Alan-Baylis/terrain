Introduction
 
[Beautiful Landscape]
[Terrain]

[Iceberg]
Start with the ice berg

    It's tiny,

    among other things

A more scalable aproach requires a form of LOD
[Colored triangles with LOD written on them]

[Optimizations]
Frustum Culling

While colored triangles are cool, unless you want to create the next
tron or geometry wars, they are not the final product.

[Black]
...fade...
[Atmosphere]
And there shall be light.

[Solid pictures]
Shading

[Texture splatting]
Texturing

[Water]
No clipping planes
Don't use discard. Use min/max.

[The Future]
Problem: Big file sizes, hard to get high res data
