Reduce overdraw by changing draw order according to camera position
	according to a simple dot with direction to center?
Reduce draws by doing 1 draw call for 4 children at same level?
persistent nodes? maybe up to a max depth...
  requires 16k nodes for a 16k map at 128:/
Do a Z prepass?
Do parallax occlusion
Find a way to combine parallax occlusion + splatting
