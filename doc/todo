Add dat.gui for global uniforms!
Update dat.gui for neonflames -> color picker!

reverse operands of scene.Transform?

fix clipping hack -> try oblique frustums
create mirror node
transform mirror plane with inverse of thee transpose of the view projection matrix.
create oblique frustum

investigate triplanar texturing
http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch01.html
investigate wangtiles or so for aperiodic textures


fix z fighting by changing near plane depending on height or so
#fix skybox rendering depth
#fix terrain cracks

UNPACK_COLORSPACE_CONVERSION_WEBGL =none

clear|deactivate stencil buffer

x Smooth gradients for normal calculation

#scale water distortion by distance

skybox reflections

color grass by dot of surface to eye normal

reflection culling wrong.


Single texture

Normal mapping
Texture Splatting

use https://github.com/toji/game-shim/blob/master/game-shim.js
- fullscreen
- mouselock
- high res timing
-> add high res timing to perfhub!

get camera to create textures

Reduce overdraw by changing draw order according to camera position
	according to a simple dot with direction to center?
Reduce draws by doing 1 draw call for 4 children at same level?
persistent nodes? maybe up to a max depth...
  requires 16k nodes for a 16k map at 128:/
Do a Z prepass?
Do parallax occlusion
Find a way to combine parallax occlusion + splatting

shadows/ambient aperture lighting
A lone tree
Shadows/Ambient aperture

Grass

Collision detection


Streaming
Graceful degradation
Turn it into a proper game

use min/max heights -> better LOD
use min/max height for clipping

Experiment with more procedural effects

Performance later:
  reduce garbage
