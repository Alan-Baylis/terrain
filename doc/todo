Add dat.gui for global uniforms!
Update dat.gui for neonflames -> color picker!

fix z fighting by changing near plane depending on height or so
fix skybox rendering depth
fix terrain cracks

- fullscreen
- mouselock
- high res timing
-> add high res timing to perfhub!

get camera to create textures

Reduce overdraw by changing draw order according to camera position
	according to a simple dot with direction to center?
Reduce draws by doing 1 draw call for 4 children at same level?
persistent nodes? maybe up to a max depth...
  requires 16k nodes for a 16k map at 128:/
Do a Z prepass?
Do parallax occlusion
Find a way to combine parallax occlusion + splatting

shadows/ambient aperture lighting
A lone tree
Shadows/Ambient aperture

Grass

Collision detection


Streaming
Graceful degradation
Turn it into a proper game

use min/max heights -> better LOD
use min/max height for clipping

Experiment with more procedural effects

Performance later:
  reduce garbage
